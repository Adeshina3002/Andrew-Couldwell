        <h6><span>ABOUT</span> THE BOOK</h6>
      <p>Laying the Foundations is a comprehensive guide to creating, documenting, and maintaining design systems, and <br>
         how to design websites and products systematically. It's an ideal <br>
          book for web designers and product designers (of all levels) and especially design teams.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    This is real talk about creating design systems and digital brand guidelines. No jargon, no glossing over the hard realities, and no company hat. Just good advice, experience, and practical tips.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    System design is not a scary thing — this book aims to dispel <br>
  that myth. It covers what design systems are, why they are <br>

  important, and how to get stakeholder buy-in to create one. It <br>
  introduces you to a simple model, and two very different <br>
    approaches to creating a design system. What's unique about <br>
    this book is its focus on the importance of brand in design <br>
      systems, web design, product design, and when creating <br>
      documentation. It's a comprehensive guide that’s simple to <br>
        follow and easy on the eye.</p>
