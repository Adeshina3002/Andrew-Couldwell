      <p class="stand">
        I work with startups and established businesses to consult on their products and design new or redesign existing digital products. I offer a range of services tailored to what you need — from an impartial review and audit of your product, to iterative improvements over time or a full-blown redesign. I can set your product and team up for success with a design system, a library of components in Figma or Sketch, and documentation to help your team work more efficiently after our work together is done.

      <h2 class="main-header">author.</h2>
      <p class="standy">In 2019, I wrote a book about how to design and build products and websites systematically, with a focus on creating a design system and a strong digital brand. I’m proud to say the book has sold in 70 countries. While the book inspires design teams to build better products, not all companies can afford to employ designers in-house or pay inflated agency rates. When you hire me, you get all the experience and knowledge in my book chanelled into your company’s brand and product, without breaking the bank.</p>

      <h2 class="main-header">audit.</h2>

      <p class="standy">The single most valuable service I offer is not design, it’s consultation. I can identify problems and opportunities in your product, user journeys, features, and brand experience that you and your team might miss. I’ll spend a few days using your product and produce a report of my findings featuring screengrabs and comments on specific elements, overview notes, and basic recommendations for potential solutions where appropriate. The review can be a standalone job that your team can action, or the start of our product design journey together.</p>

    <p class="standy">As our time working together may be limited to only a few weeks or months, each of the services I offer are designed to set your business and team up for success in the long term. Depending on your needs and budget, I can provide one or all of these services:</p>

        <h4>Design Exploration</h4>
        <p class="halve">For a new product, we’d start by discussing your business and product goals, then I would design a concept that we’d iterate on until we have a build-ready product. For an existing product, a review is a great place to start. From there we can discuss the merits of re-working what you have currently, or starting again with a new design. Ultimately, we’ll be creating a design system driven product.</p>

        <h4>Design Library</h4>
        <p class="halve">Design libraries are a toolkit of all the component parts of your product including anything from buttons to colours, text styles, form inputs, and larger design patterns. Using this library (in Figma or Sketch), anybody at your company can quickly and easily iterate on your product. Libraries keep your product consistent, save time, and free your team to focus on important tasks.</p>

        <h4>Documentation</h4>
        <p class="halve">Products evolve over time, adapting to ever-changing business needs and user behaviour. Maintaining the integrity of a product after a new design has been implemented is hard, especially if you have a team of people working on it. Documenting design decisions, intent, and use cases for design system elements helps to keep product teams in check and onboard new team members.</p>

        <h4>Marketing</h4>
        <p class="halve">Launching and growing a startup, establishing a brand, and attracting new users doesn’t stop at designing and building a great product. I can design, build, and creatively direct supporting materials like a website or transactional and marketing email templates to help you promote your new product, subscribe early adopters pre-launch, or market new features.</p>

       <div id="big-header">
      <h2 class="main-header">Burger King.</h2>
      <p class="standy">In 2021, Restaurant Brands International hired me to take Jones Knowles Ritchie’s brilliant new branding for Burger King, and adapt it for their website and app experiences*. The scope soon grew exponentially to leading the creation of a white label design system for RBI’s three brands; Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes. The work involved establishing and documenting digital brand guidelines, a design system, extensive product audits, responsive web and app design, creative direction, and working closely with a team of engineers and product managers.</p>

      <h2 class="main-header y-1">Adobe</h2>
      <h2 class="main-header y-1">Portfolio.</h2>
      <p class="y-2">I worked full-time on this portfolio builder for creatives from 2014-2016 at <span class="z-1">Behance</span> in New York City. When I took over, the product was known as ProSite and some preliminary ideas had already been concepted. During my time at Behance, I was the solo designer and creative director of this product, working with a large team of engineers on all product design, concepts, features, and brand. I even named the product Portfolio!.</p>
